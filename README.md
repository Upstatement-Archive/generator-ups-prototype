# generator-ups-prototype

A generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) to create prototype web sites.

## Usage

This isn't part of the public yeoman registry, so you'll have to install it locally first.

1. clone it (with gitbox or on the command line with `git clone git@github.com:Upstatement/generator-ups-prototype.git`)
2. `cd` in to the `generator-ups-prototype` directory and run `npm link`

Now you should be all set to use it!

## Try it out!

* create a new directory (like in `~/Sandbox/testing-prototype`)
* `cd` in to the `testing-prototype` dir
* run `yo ups-prototype`

Voila! It should ask you a few questions about your prototype, and before you know it, you'll have a nice boilerplate project complete with SASS stuff and a starter JS module.
